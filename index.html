                <p>Our journey started from the home science class, you found a helpless Arav trying to make a group for a subject that he had no interest in and yet you helped me throughout the year with the subject. After school, we never talked frequently and slowly after a couple of years of not hearing from each other we started talking more often and by the end of 2023 you were the most important person in my life. And now it's 2025 after all those years of a lot of ups and downs you still remain the most important person in my life.</p>

                <p>After ages of talking and endless video calls our schedules finally lined up and we met in the freezing cold of Delhi on 2nd January 2024. Seeing you irl in your pink jacket and hearing your laugh for the first time was magical. Food was pretty mid but the little time I spent with you was the best I had felt in ages. From getting you ice cream, sending our pics to my mom, telling the cab driver the wrong address by mistake, getting entry into IIT, gossip about school and tons more everything about that day was good but you just made it better.</p>

                <p>From the moment we met, I've been in awe of how truly amazing you are. Your kindness radiates in everything you do, whether itâ€™s the way you lend a listening ear to a friend in need or how you light up a room with your laughter. I admire your passion for life and the dedication you show in pursuing your dreams, inspiring me to chase my own with the same josh. The little things you doâ€”like your thoughtful texts/calls and the way you always know how to make me smileâ€”remind me every day of how lucky I am to have you by my side. You are not just another friend; you are my bestest friend, my confidante, and my greatest supporter. I canâ€™t wait to see what the future holds for us, but I know that with you, it will be nothing short of extraordinary.</p>
